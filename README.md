## Intro

Battle Technomancer :robot: [LVL 33]. While rather powerful in his natural 
habitat, still would be one-shotted by world-class being like Musk the 
Space Lord :milky_way: [lvl ??].

```Technomancer - Highly adaptive software developer thriving in unknown territory. Utilizes vast spectrum of knowledge to creatively solve hard problems. Prefers to take on challanging quests to level-up efficiently.```

I love exploring the vast cosmos of knowledge flying from one adventure to the next. Deeper dives in confined topic spaces are not my favorite tasks, though I understand some quests require thorough invesigation. Give me a quest, the adventure, and payment, and I'll be your technomancer on any mission. 



## Projects

### Links to github pages of the bigger projects illustrating some of my skills:

- [Burger Maker app for a burger serving restaurant](https://github.com/Tsubanee/burger-app)
- [Dragon Auctions, app which allows to create auctions with photos and stylized description by authenticated users](https://github.com/Tsubanee/Flutter)

Some of the other small but impactful projects I implemented/techs I tinkered with:
 - machine learning (Andrew Ng's course on coursea)
 - restAPI in Flask
 - Azure Functions (function that encrypted payload sent to the restAPI endpoint and returned it in response)
 - python scripting and automatation
 - linux ricing (fork on LARBS) and fine-tuning archlinux to suit my preferences
 - static websites (also staticly rendered websites on vercel)
